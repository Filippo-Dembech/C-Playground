# C++ Playground

## Why This Playground

It's local. You can use Vim/Neovim to edit your playground code. I've always found frustrating online Playground that close every time I type `Ctrl + W`.

## Requirements

- Node.js v.16.0.0+
- C++ compiler in `PATH`

## How To Install

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Run `watch-app.js` in a terminal to run `main.cpp` code in real time

> NOTE: `watch-app.js` compiles and runs `main.cpp` code every time the `main.cpp` code changes.
